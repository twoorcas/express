# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Here I work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The goal was to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
